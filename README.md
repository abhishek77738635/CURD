# CURD
Description:
This project is a full-stack web application built using Express.js for the backend and React.js for the frontend. The primary purpose of this application is to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a dataset stored in a database.

Key Features:

Express.js Backend: The backend is developed using Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. Express.js provides robust routing, middleware support, and facilitates easy integration with databases.
React.js Frontend: The frontend is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React.js allows for the creation of dynamic and interactive UI components, making the application responsive and user-friendly.
Database Integration: The application integrates with a database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store and manage the dataset. MongoDB is commonly used for its flexibility with JSON-like documents, but other databases can be utilized based on project requirements.
Table Display: The frontend includes a table component to display the dataset retrieved from the backend. This table provides an organized view of the data, making it easy for users to browse and interact with.
Form for Data Manipulation: A form component is implemented in the frontend to facilitate data manipulation operations such as adding new records, editing existing ones, and deleting records. Users can input data via the form, which is then processed by the backend and stored or updated in the database accordingly.
CRUD Operations: The application supports CRUD operations, enabling users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete records within the dataset. These operations are performed seamlessly through the frontend interface, with requests handled by the backend API endpoints.
Overall, this CURD project serves as a practical demonstration of integrating Express.js and React.js to create a dynamic web application with database functionality, empowering users to efficiently manage and manipulate data.
